# Positioning Strategy

How to position LittleInkStain's work across different contexts and opportunities.

---

## Core Identity

**LittleInkStain** creates psychologically intense, emotionally raw work that sits at the intersection of:
- Outsider art traditions
- Mental health expression
- Intuitive mark-making
- Psychological portraiture

The work is **not therapeutic art** (made for healing) but **art about the experience of living with a complex inner world**.

---

## Positioning Variants

### For Outsider Art Contexts

**Emphasis:** Self-taught development, raw technique, authenticity over academic training

**Language:**
- "Intuitive practice developed outside formal art education"
- "Work emerges from necessity rather than training"
- "Unmediated expression, unfiltered by institutional conventions"

**Avoid:** Overemphasising mental health (can be reductive in outsider contexts)

---

### For Mental Health Contexts

**Emphasis:** Lived experience, psychological depth, destigmatisation

**Language:**
- "Art informed by lived experience of mental health"
- "Visual language for experiences that resist verbal articulation"
- "Work that witnesses and validates psychological complexity"

**Avoid:** Pathologising; positioning as "recovery" or "inspiration" narrative

---

### For Contemporary Art Contexts

**Emphasis:** Conceptual rigour, art historical awareness, medium specificity

**Language:**
- "Practice interrogating the boundaries of self-representation"
- "Work in dialogue with traditions of psychological portraiture"
- "Material investigation of vulnerability and exposure"

**Avoid:** Over-emphasising outsider status (can be dismissive in some contemporary contexts)

---

### For Commercial Contexts

**Emphasis:** Collectability, emotional resonance, unique voice

**Language:**
- "Distinctive visual language with strong collector following"
- "Work that commands emotional attention"
- "Emerging artist with institutional interest"

**Avoid:** Leading with mental health (can limit commercial framing)

---

## Framing Matrix

| Context | Lead With | Support With | Avoid |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Outsider art | Intuitive practice | Psychological depth | Academic credentials |
| Mental health | Lived experience | Artistic rigour | "Recovery" narratives |
| Contemporary | Conceptual angle | Emotional intensity | "Untrained" framing |
| Commercial | Visual distinctiveness | Growing recognition | Illness-centred framing |

---

## Narrative Arc

**Past:** Developed practice intuitively, outside formal art structures, driven by psychological necessity

**Present:** Building visibility through aligned opportunities, developing collector base, institutional interest growing

**Future:** Positioning for representation, museum acquisition, sustained visibility in outsider/mental health art spaces

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **Authenticity** — Work emerges from genuine psychological experience, not aesthetic strategy
2. **Intensity** — Uncompromising emotional directness
3. **Consistency** — Recognisable visual language across works
4. **Alignment** — Clear fit with outsider and mental health art ecosystems
