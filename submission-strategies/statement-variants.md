## Statement Writing Principles

1. **Avoid jargon** — Clear language over art-speak
2. **Be specific** — Concrete details over abstractions
3. **Show don't tell** — Describe the work, not its importance
4. **Authentic voice** — Sound like the artist, not a press release
5. **Active verbs** — "I make" not "My practice involves"
6. **No apologies** — Confident without arrogance
