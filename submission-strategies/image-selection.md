# Image Selection Strategy

Guidelines for selecting and presenting images for submissions.

---

## General Principles

1. **Lead with strength** — First image should be the most compelling
2. **Show range within coherence** — Variety without seeming scattered
3. **Match the context** — Select images that speak to the specific opportunity
4. **Quality over quantity** — Fewer strong images beat many weak ones
5. **Recent work first** — Unless historical work is specifically relevant

## Image Categories

### A-Tier (Signature Works)
Works that best represent the practice:
- Highest visual impact
- Strongest psychological intensity
- Most recognisable style
- Best technical execution

*Use for: Major opportunities, first impressions, competitive submissions*

### B-Tier (Strong Supporting)
Works that expand the narrative:
- Show range within the practice
- Demonstrate technical variety
- Fill thematic gaps
- Strong but not definitive

*Use for: Supplementary images, larger submissions, context-setting*

### C-Tier (Contextual)
Works that serve specific purposes:
- Older work showing development
- Experiments or series work
- Niche thematic fits
- Documentary/process images

*Use for: Artist statements, development narratives, specific thematic calls*
