# Pricing & Fees Strategy

Framework for pricing work and evaluating submission costs.

---

## Pricing Philosophy

**Price for sustainability, not speculation.**

Prices should:
- Cover materials and time at minimum
- Reflect current career stage honestly
- Allow room for growth
- Be consistent across contexts

---

## Pricing Framework

### Factors to Consider

1. **Materials cost** — Actual cost of supplies
2. **Time invested** — Hours at a reasonable rate
3. **Size** — Larger works command higher prices
4. **Complexity** — Technical difficulty or detail
5. **Series position** — First in series vs. later works
6. **Comparable sales** — What similar artists charge
7. **Context** — Gallery vs. direct vs. studio sale

### Starting Formula

```
Base Price = (Materials × 2) + (Hours × Hourly Rate) + Size Factor
```

### Size Guidelines

| Size Category | Approximate Range |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Small (<30cm) | £100–300 |
| Medium (30-60cm) | £300–600 |
| Large (60-100cm) | £600–1200 |
| Very Large (>100cm) | £1200+ |

*These are starting points. Adjust based on market feedback.*

## Gallery Commission Structure

| Venue Type | Typical Commission | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Commercial gallery | 40-50% | Standard |
| Non-profit / artist-run | 25-35% | Often lower |
| Outsider art specialist | 30-40% | Varies |
| Open exhibition | 30-40% | One-time |
| Direct / studio sale | 0% | Keep full amount |

**When pricing for gallery:** Set price so your take-home is acceptable after commission.

## Submission Fee Evaluation

### Worth Paying

- Established institutions (RA, major open exhibitions)
- Aligned opportunities (outsider/mental health focus)
- Low fee relative to visibility (under £30 for major exposure)
- Track record of quality shows

### Approach with Caution

- High fees (>£50) for unknown venues
- Fees plus exhibition fees
- Fees plus high commission
- No clear past artist quality

### Avoid

- Vanity galleries (pay-to-show models)
- Excessive fees with no selection
- Hidden costs revealed post-acceptance
- "Competition" with minimal prizes

## Fee Tracking

| Opportunity | Fee | Worth It? | Outcome | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----------|---------|-------|
| | | | | |

*Populate with actual submissions for pattern recognition.*

---

## Price Consistency

Maintain consistent pricing across:
- Gallery vs. studio sales (or explain differential)
- Similar-sized works
- Same period of production

**Don't:** Undercut gallery prices with direct sales (destroys relationships)

**Do:** Offer studio discounts transparently if appropriate

---

## Annual Review

Review pricing annually based on:
- Sales volume
- Market feedback
- Career developments
- Comparable artist movements
- Cost of living changes
