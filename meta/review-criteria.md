# Review Criteria

Scoring and filtering framework for evaluating open calls.

## Core Principles

Every opportunity is evaluated through a **cost–benefit lens** that balances visibility with sustainability.

**The question is not "Could I submit?" but "Should I submit?"**

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Thematic Alignment (Weight: High)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| ★★★★★ | Explicitly outsider art, mental health, or psychological expression focused |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong implicit alignment (raw, unfiltered, emotional, neurodivergent themes) |
| ★★★☆☆ | Broad theme that accommodates the work without centring it |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Tangential fit requiring significant framing effort |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Poor fit; would require compromising artistic voice |

### 2. Reputational Signal (Weight: High)

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **High** | Established institution, critical recognition, strong artist alumni, press coverage |
| **Medium** | Respected within niche, emerging but credible, good peer network |
| **Low** | Unknown, vanity-style, pay-to-play without clear benefit |

### 3. Financial Cost (Weight: Medium-High)

Consider total outlay:
- Submission fees
- Exhibition/participation fees
- Framing/presentation costs
- Shipping/transport
- Commission on sales

**Red flags:**
- High upfront fees with low selection rates
- Commission >50% without corresponding exposure
- Hidden costs revealed post-acceptance

### 4. Time & Energy (Weight: Medium)

- Application complexity (new statement required? specific formats?)
- Deadline pressure
- Emotional cost of rejection from high-stakes applications
- Opportunity cost vs. studio time

### 5. Acceptance Likelihood (Weight: Medium)

Based on:
- Selection rate (if known)
- Past artists shown (style/career stage alignment)
- Number of submissions typically received
- Juror preferences (if identifiable)

---

## Decision Framework

### Strongly Recommend
- High thematic alignment + Medium-High reputation + Reasonable cost
- Clear pathway to future opportunities
- Builds specific narrative or credential

### Recommend with Caveats
- Good alignment but higher cost
- Unknown reputation but interesting context
- Requires effort but offers learning opportunity

### Document but Do Not Recommend
- Low alignment requiring significant compromise
- High cost relative to likely benefit
- Vanity signals or pay-to-play patterns
- Emotional cost outweighs potential gain

### Skip Entirely
- Actively misaligned themes
- Predatory fee structures
- No credible pathway to visibility or sales

---

## Ongoing Calibration

This framework should be updated based on:
- Submission outcomes (what works?)
- Feedback received
- Changes in career stage or goals
- Market/ecosystem shifts
