# LittleInkStain Open Calls

A living intelligence system for discovering, evaluating, and executing art open calls and opportunities.

## Purpose

This repository serves as the source of truth for a UK-based artist focused on **outsider art**, **mental health–aligned work**, and **psychologically expressive practices**.

It exists to:
- **Reduce cognitive load** — so creative energy goes to making, not admin
- **Compound visibility** — by systematically tracking what works
- **Protect time** — by filtering signal from noise
- **Build durable reputation** — through strategic, aligned submissions

## Structure

```
/open-calls           → Active opportunities, organised by year and theme
/galleries            → Profiles of relevant galleries and institutions
/submission-strategies → Positioning, statements, pricing, image selection
/outcomes             → Submission log, results, impact tracking
/meta                 → Sources, review criteria, operating principles
```

## Philosophy

**Optimise for signal, not volume.**

Not every opportunity is worth pursuing. This system prioritises:
- Thematic alignment over prestige
- Sustainable costs over speculative exposure
- Long-term reputation over short-term visibility
- Emotional sustainability over hustle

## How It Works

1. **Discover** — Continuously research open calls from galleries, institutions, charities, artist-run spaces, hospitals, universities, magazines, and mental-health–aligned organisations
2. **Evaluate** — Score each opportunity using cost–benefit criteria documented in `/meta/review-criteria.md`
3. **Execute** — For recommended calls, provide submission briefs with rationale, artwork suggestions, and cost estimates
4. **Learn** — Track all submissions and outcomes to identify patterns over time

## Coverage

**Primary:** UK and Europe  
**Secondary:** High-signal opportunities elsewhere

**Themes:** Outsider art, mental health, psychological expression, raw/unfiltered work, neurodivergent perspectives, emotional vulnerability
